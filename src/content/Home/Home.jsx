	                    She is now the administrator for her son, the Observed.&nbsp;&nbsp;She can customize the list of Antecedents, Behaviors, Consequences and Locations that
	                    best fit her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;She can enter behavior incidents and view his behavior log.

                        They can fill the sheets out and return to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She then enters the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, they can register as users and the mother grants 
                        them access to her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the mother grants access, her son will be accessible to them when they sign in.

	                    Export the log to MS Excel then email or print it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the Analyst can register as a user and the mother can grant access to the Analyst.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Analyst only needs to view the behavior log the mother would grant LOG access.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	                    Accessing the log through <b>My ABC data</b> allows the Analyst to see an up to date log without being dependent on someone else to provide it.
